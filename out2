I do not like research.
What type of research do you do ? Are you a scientist or structural engineer ? What is your favorite type of work ?
I am a scientist . I would say I take care of the environment , but I do some government work as well .
I am currently vacationing in Thailand for the first time . What has changed in the environment ?
Have you been to Hong Kong yet ? I 've also been to Thailand before ! How is the weather ?
I have not been there . I wish I could have , but it is very cold in the east .
Yeah , I understand . I hope to live in a tropical climate once I 'm back in my life .
That sounds like a great idea ! I ''d love to live somewhere warmer than Thailand - tropical or subtropical ?
I would love to go , but I think Hawaii would be a little too cold to do me right .
Did you like it ? From my research , I 'd say it is in the mid to high 80s .
I did , but she will need some sun well for that ! She had a lot of fun there , and I did enjoy it !
I hope she loved it there , because it sounds really beautiful . How was her vacation ? Is it fun to travel with a family ?
I haven ' t been to Thailand yet , but my wife would really like to go to Thailand .
Wow , that would be interesting ! I think it would be very relaxing . What ' s your favorite food ?
I don ' t eat a lot of food , but I 'm a fan of lasagna . What is the most popular kind of food in Thailand ?
Thai food is definitely the most heavily market in Thailand and quite popular . It ' s also the 3rd most populous city by area .
I wish there was good Thai food there , as it makes me want to go there ! lol
Oh no ! I thought you said Thailand was the best country in South Asia ! Haha ! I hope you make it !
Thanks ! It 's ll definitely be a change , I think . Have a great night ! ! !
You , too , have a good one ! ; ) Have a wonderful evening ! : ) ) ! !
Thanks ! You too have a great evening ! Do you want to go anywhere other than Thailand ?
